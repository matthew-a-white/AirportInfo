# AirportInfo

NOTE:
The API used to obtain the necessary information seems to be deprecated as no information is no longer available.

Fix:
Find out about any possible changes to the API causing the lack of data.


Displaying information regarding wait times at TSA airport security lines as well as parking spaces available (if available).

The reason that the code is all hosted in one html file is because it simplifies the process for allowing access on my phone.

Occasionally the TSA provides faulty data where there is a checkpointIndex that does not refer to any checkpoint according to the data provided by the TSA.

Need to add support for mobile
